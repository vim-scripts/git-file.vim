This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2185

Allows for opening <branch>:<file> patters using a git repo.

You can open a file from the shell:

    vim HEAD~10:filename

or from inside vim:

    :e branch:filename
    :sp tag:filename

you could even check what changed between the current edits and another revision:

    :diffthis
    :vsp HEAD:%
    :diffthis

but that's what gitdiff.vim (vimscript#1846) is for.
